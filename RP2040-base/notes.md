# Bugs
- Not compliant with jlcpcb design rules
- no explanation about the flash chip
- jlcpcb doesn't have basic 27 ohm resistors

# Improvements
- C4 could use a slightly better position (giving more space to GPIO0-7
- U2 could be closer to U1
- if chip were not at 45 degrees, that might have allowed for a smaller footprint
- rp2040 3d model, add pi logo
- jlcpcb part numbers
