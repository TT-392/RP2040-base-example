# Bugs
Not compliant with jlcpcb design rules
no explanation about the flash chip
Crystal is no longer a basic part? there seems to be a different 12MHz crystal in its place

# Improvements
C4 could use a sligghtly better position (giving more space to GPIO0-7
U2 could be closer to U1
if chip were not at 45 degrees, that might have allowed for a smaller footprint
rp2040 3d model, add pi logo
